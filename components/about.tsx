        Hey there! I'm a{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">
          Computer Science and Engineering graduate
        </span>{" "}
        with a bit of an adventurous streak. While I've got a solid foundation
        in web development with{" "}
        <span className="italic">NextJS, React, Python, and MySQL</span>, I'm
        not one to be confined to just one stack. In my free time, I love diving
        into different technologies and building side projects â€“ it's like a
        developer playground!
      </p>
      <p className="mb-5 text-lg leading-8">
        Speaking of playgrounds, I'm actually looking to expand mine further.
        I've dabbled in <span className="font-bold">Web Development</span>,{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">Infrastructure</span>,{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">ETL</span>, and even some{" "}
        <span className="font-bold">DevOps</span> , and I'm fascinated by the
        way it all connects. My ideal role would be one where I can grow into a
        well-rounded developer, comfortable building both the front-end and the
        behind-the-scenes magic that makes things tick.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-8">
        So, if you're looking for someone who's eager to learn and passionate
        about building cool stuff, let's chat! I'm always up for a good
        challenge.
